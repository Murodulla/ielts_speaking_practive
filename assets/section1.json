Currently, I'm working at Manilamed, one the best medical centres here in Manila. As a staff nurse, I'm responsible for lots of different things such as preparing patients for examinations and surgery, observing and recording their conditions, measuring and recording their vital signs and weight, administering medications, preparing rooms, cleaning and disinfecting equipment and instruments, or assisting doctors during surgery. Plus, every day I perform a wide range of tasks to provide care to my patients and resolve their problems. For instance, I feed patients who cannot feed themselves, dress patients with physical challenges, help ambulatory patients walk, turn bedridden patients to prevent pressure sores, sometimes I have to transport patients. You see, there's no such thing as a routine day in a hospital, and you just never know what to expect. It's a very tough job, but I like it.

Mainly because <u>I have an opportunity to take on new challenges all the time</u>, which I really like. In fact, the more challenging the task or the project, the more I like it. You know, if I could do the work with my eyes closed, I swear I would die of boredom, and I would quit my job even though it pays really well. So every time my boss gives me a new challenging task, I feel totally psyched. You know, there is just something beautiful about encountering obstacles and finding ways to overcome them. And then every time I finish a difficult project or task successfully, I feel like I’m flying. My confidence skyrockets and I feel proud of myself, which helps me grow both professionally and personally, and expand my comfort zone.

							"text": "(for nurses) Do you like your job?<br><arrow>Absolutely. <u>The most rewarding thing about being a nurse is making a difference in the lives of others, whether it be helping patients recover more quickly or helping them pass away as peacefully and comfortably as possible</u>. I find real satisfaction in providing good medical care and emotional support to patients (and oftentimes to their relatives). (You can find the video featuring this answer on our YouTube channel called IELTS Speaking Assistant, playlist SAMPLE ANSWERS)"
						},
						{
							"text": "(for nurses) Is there anything you dislike about your job?<br><arrow>I'd rather say there are things that are really hard to manage or cope with. The hardest thing about being a nurse is that <u>you have to handle extremely high levels of stress</u> 'cause, first of all, <u>you have to deal with life and death every day</u>. Plus, <u>you never know what's gonna happen in the next second</u>. And <u>there's always someone who's complaining about something</u>. Sometimes it feels like they're just trying to test the limits of your patience</u>. Also, <u>you have to work long hours, work on weekends, holidays and during night shifts</u>, which is also stressful and exhausting. What's more, <u>you spend most of the time walking, standing, lifting and bending, sometimes moving heavy equipment</u>. It's a demanding job. But despite all this, I don't think I could do anything but nursing now. (You can find the video featuring this answer on our YouTube channel called IELTS Speaking Assistant, playlist SAMPLE ANSWERS)"
						},
						{
							"text": "(for people who have to deal with deadlines) What do you dislike about your job?<br><arrow>The one thing I hate about my job is that I always have <u>to work against the clock to meet deadlines</u>. Unrealistic deadlines. And believe me, I know the difference between 'unrealistic' and just 'challenging'. So what I'm dreaming of now is <u>a slower paced job</u> 'cause I'd like <u>to feel one step ahead, not constantly behind</u>.

Of course, when I chose this job, I knew what I was getting into, but now <u>I'm feeling so overwhelmed</u> that I just wanna stop and shake my shoulders to get rid of this burden.

And I've noticed that <u>it has already started taking its toll on my work productivity</u> 'cause having terrifyingly long to-do lists day by day does nothing but prevent me from focusing on tasks that are critical to the success of the company. And the worst thing is that I don't feel comfortable delegating. So I just continue carrying the weight of the world on my shoulders, feeling stressed and exhausted all the time.

Speaking of architecture, one of the most iconic masterpieces in Baku is the Heydar Aliyev cultural centre, designed by the renowned architect Zaha Hadid. This center is known for its distinctive architecture and flowing curved style that avoids sharp angles. Apart from its architectural wonders, Baku is famous for a couple of interesting characteristics. Many locals would tell you that itэs a windy city, experiencing gusts of wind throughout the year.

More than 60 percent of Hong Kong is made up of green spaces, beaches and mountains. It's surprising, isn't it? Another interesting fact about Hong Kong is that it's one of the most expensive places to live in the world. Despite this, it's also one of the most heavily populated cities, with more than 7 million people living here. And because it's so densely populated, it's common for the buildings to be super tall and for the apartments to be super small. Some people say the density of Hong Kong is suffocating, but I'm used to it. And I think it's a truly unique place.

							"text": "What is Cebu famous for?<br><arrow>One of the things that make Cebu a unique city is its breathtaking white sand beaches that are surrounded by mesmerizing crystal blue waters such as Sumilon, Malapascua, and Bantayan Island. Also, it's well-known for diverse marine life and pristine coral reefs, which entice divers to explore locations such as Pescador Island in Moalboal, known for the sardine run and turtle point, and Oslob, where you can have the incredible experience of swimming alongside magnificent whale sharks. And, of course, I can't help mentioning its unique Cebuano cuisine, particularly lechon, which is a whole pig slowly roasted over glowing coals. It's considered the centerpiece of fiestas, birthday celebrations, and various other joyous occasions in Cebu. "

							"text": "What is Davao City famous for?<br><arrow>First and foremost, Davao City is known for its delicious durian fruit, which you can find all over the place. So it's sometimes referred to as the 'Durian Capital of the Philippines'. Second, the city is famous for its orchids and has lots of orchid farms and nurseries. So it's also known as the 'Orchid Capital of the Philippines'. It even hosts an annual Kadayawan Festival, which includes a floral float parade that showcases the city's orchid varieties and other flowers. Lastly, it's home to many iconic landmarks such as the Philippine Eagle Center, a conservation center for the critically endangered Philippine Eagle, Mount Apo, the highest mountain in the Philippines, the Davao Crocodile Park, and People's Park."

							"text": "What is Riyadh famous for?<br><arrow>Riyadh is <u>like two worlds in one, with a mix of old and new</u> that's pretty cool. There are these crazy tall buildings that look like they're from the future, like the Kingdom Centre and the Burj Rafal. And then you've got these old-school places that provide a glimpse into the city's past, like the Al Masmak Fortress and the Murabba Palace. And I can't help mentioning the old Diriyah district. It's got these super old buildings and narrow streets that make you feel like you're in a totally different time period. So everywhere you go in Riyadh, you're surrounded by cool stuff that's either really modern or super old. And it's what makes this city so unique and interesting to explore.

First, traffic can be really bad, especially during rush hour, and some parts of the city don't have proper sidewalks so you have to be careful sharing the space with cars. Also, when it rains, the drainage isn't always great so streets can get flooded pretty easily. Lastly, pickpocketing is a common problem here. So you need to keep an eye on your pockets and bags. "

It’s more than frustrating. Unfortunately, this list goes on and on. There are <u>too few green zones</u> so the city looks like <u>the forest of high-rise office and residential buildings</u>.

It’s not far from Rakhiv, a small town in the Carpathian Mountains. In fact, it’s just a board with an inscription. Another interesting fact I found out about recently is that with 70% of Ukrainian adults having a secondary or higher education <u>Ukraine ranks fourth among the most educated nations, and it has the fourth highest number of certified IT professionals in the world</u>. However, I don’t know how reliable this information is.  Also, <u>one quarter of the world’s black soil reserves are located in Ukraine</u>. And because of its properties our black soil is considered best in the world. <u>Well, what else… the country is washed by the waters of the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov</u> in the south. And <u>there’s a mountain range</u> in the west. To tell the truth, I can spend hours speaking about my country."
