					"text": "<arrow>I'm sure a rare example of someone with seemingly boundless energy is my grandfather. It seems his motto is, \"Life's too short to be idle.\" <p>Now in his late 70s and retired, he could sleep late, spend more time in bed, read books, or watch TV. But instead, he's always on the go, despite his age. He wakes up with the sun and starts his day with morning exercises outdoors, regardless of the weather or season. Then he gets to work on chores like washing and cleaning. Since my grandmother passed away 20 years ago, he's done all the housework himself. He also works in the yard, the orchard, and his vegetable garden. Yet, he never seems to feel tired. At least, he never says he's tired. In fact, the more he does, the more energized he seems to get. It's incredible. I'm just 30, and I'm nowhere near as active as him. At the end of the day, I can't wait to get home and collapse on the couch. My grandfather, on the other hand, is always up for an evening stroll. I rely on extra-large coffees to get through the day, but he never relies on caffeine. He believes the most powerful source of energy comes from within. </p><p>When people ask him how he stays so energized, he always says there are three keys to living a vibrant life. First, he says his energy levels are directly tied to how refreshed he feels each morning. He never sacrifices sleep, especially for TV, and he eats well. Second, he surrounds himself with the right people - those who are passionate about life, knowledge, and work - and avoids people who constantly complain. Finally, he believes in doing something meaningful with his time. He spreads enthusiasm to everyone around him, and his energy is infectious. I can't help admiring him and wish there were more people like him."

He started his career as a doctor's assistant, and later became a doctor. He examined, diagnosed and treated patients. He literally worked day and night. I think it was hard. Very hard. But I'm sure that he did exactly what he was born to do, and he wouldn't have changed his job for all the world. For him, it wasn't just a job, it was his calling. <p> My grandfather's work occupied all his time. He never had a second job. It was just impossible as he had no time for that. If he had had a second job, he would have died of fatigue. Sometimes I doubted my grandfather was a human being. He didn't have hobbies. He didn't spend time with friends. He even missed most family gatherings. You know, it's not fun at all. He was always tired, and his eyes were always red because of endless sleepless nights. When he wasn't on duty, he was reading different books and reviewing medical records of his patients. </p><p>In my opinion, it is a very rewarding job. But I wouldn't like to do anything like that because it's really stressful, especially when you understand that you cannot help some patient. Plus, shift work is not my thing. I can't imagine myself working night shifts. What's more, I don't want to sacrifice everything for work. "

This was exactly the case. Since I couldn't sleep, I stared out of the window. It was almost dawn, so I could barely see anything, but it was still better than staring at the back of the seat in front of me. </p><p>Suddenly I heard a dull thud, and a few minutes later, the bus stopped. The driver got off to check, but he didn’t come back for half an hour. </p><p>At first, everything seemed ok. All the passengers were sleeping and had no idea something was wrong. If I had been able to sleep, I probably wouldn’t have noticed anything either. But unfortunately, I wasn’t as lucky as the others. </p><p>Several hours later everyone woke up and realized that we were stuck in the middle of nowhere. The worst part? There was no toilet - not even trees or bushes in sight. Just an endless field. For people like me, who are used to modern conveniences, it was a nightmare.</p><p><u>As time went on, people grew angrier by the hour. Some passengers even lost their temper and started yelling at the driver, even though it wasn’t his fault. He was doing everything he could to fix the problem, but it wasn’t easy. </p><p><u>We ended up spending five or six hours on the side of the highway before we could finally continue the journey.</u>.

My grandpa even said he was more afraid to die of loneliness than of coronavirus. So since the pandemic, I’ve been visiting them more often to make up for the time we lost even though it takes me 5 hours to get there. <p>My grandparents live in a quiet and beautiful place by the river. They have a cozy house with a big garden. There are lots of flowers, and sometimes orchids bloom too. You know, being there is like travelling back in time. Everything reminds me of my carefree childhood: my toys, old CDs, my bicycle. It feels like you step into another world. All the walls are still covered with old wallpaper. My grandmother doesn’t allow us to remove it, and she refuses to get their house refurbished because she wants to keep all their memories alive. She says they both love their 50-year-old chairs and armchairs, their old wooden table in the kitchen, paintings, clay pots, old pictures, and lots of things they bought when they were young. </p><p>You know, I think she’s right. There’s something special about this old house. It’s a magical place, and I really love spending time there. When I visit, I enjoy going fishing and exploring the countryside during the day. In the evenings, I watch the sunset from the backyard. I drink hot tea and eat cinnamon buns. My grandmother always bakes them when I come because she knows how much I love them. If I didn't have so much on my plate and if the trip didn't take so long, I would visit them more often."

				{
					"text": "<arrow>So, at my work, there's this one rule that everyone knows about, and <u>it's all about being on time</u>. It's a pretty simple rule, really. But it's super important for keeping things running smoothly. I mean we work in a busy office where we have to coordinate a lot of tasks and projects. If someone is late, it can mess up the whole schedule. Meetings get delayed, deadlines get pushed back, and it can be a real headache for everyone. So if it weren't for this rule, we would have a really hard time getting work done. Literally. <p>So, I totally get why this rule is in place, and I actually think it's a good one. It helps us stay organized and make sure we're all on the same page. Plus, it shows respect for our colleagues and the company because we're valuing everyone's time. </p><p>But here's the thing: not everyone followed this rule. There were a few coworkers who were constantly late, and it was frustrating. It was not fair to the rest of us who made an effort to be on time, and it often created tension in the office. </p><p>Now, if someone does break this rule and is late without a good reason, there are consequences. Usually, our boss will have a chat with them and remind them of the importance of being punctual. If it keeps happening, they might get a formal warning. And if it continues after that, well, they could even lose their job. </p><p>So, while the rule about being on time might seem strict, I think it's necessary to keep things running smoothly and maintain a respectful work environment. And personally, I'm all for it because it makes my workday a lot less stressful."
				},
				{
					"text": "<arrow>In my school, there's this really long list of rules we have to follow. Most of them are there to make sure the school is safe and orderly and that we students behave ourselves. But some of these rules are just way too strict. Like, <u>we have to wear a uniform</u>. Girls wear a shirt, a knee-length woolen skirt, socks or tights, and shoes. Boys wear a shirt and trousers. And we can only buy our uniforms from one specific place to make sure we all look exactly the same. No other options are allowed. Then there's the whole thing about how we look. Piercings are not allowed. No jewelry, no makeup, and we can't even have our hair dyed. If you have long hair, it has to be tied back all the time.<p>Now, don't get me wrong, I get that wearing a uniform is practical and it helps keep distractions in check. When everyone dresses the same way, it's easier to focus on schoolwork instead of what people are wearing. And no one gets teased for not following fashion trends, which is nice.</p><p>But honestly, at my school, these rules are just over the top. I mean, I get it if we came to school in ripped jeans, that's not cool. But why the heck should plain blue jeans with no fancy stuff be a problem. Shirts have to be tucked in, which is fine. It makes us look neat. But if your socks aren't pulled up or your shoes' heel straps aren't perfect, you can be sent home or given a talking to.  And if you dare to wear even tiny earrings, they make you take them out. You can't even go back to class until your parents meet with the principal or teacher. That's insane. And for the boys, if they wear the wrong kind of shoes or trousers, they can get detention or even suspended for one to ten days. Thank God, we don't have physical punishment. </p><p>Honestly, without the uniform policy, I think we'd be showing up in all sort of outfits like sweaters, short skirts, hoodies, you name it. Most of us would probably have tattoos and piercings galore. It'd be a total mess. But the extreme rules we have in our school aren't much better."

It was a stable job with a steady income, but deep down I knew I wasn't happy. I felt like I was stuck in a rut and there were no opportunities to grow professionally or be promoted. I had always dreamed of starting my own business, but the idea of leaving my stable job and taking such a big risk was terrifying.

I began to realize that if I didn't make a change soon, I might regret it for the rest of my life. <p>I started doing research, talking to other entrepreneurs, and developing a business plan. I also spoke to my friends and family about my decision and sought their support. </p><p><u>It wasn't an easy decision to leave my stable job</u>, but I knew it was the right one. I was nervous about the financial risk and the potential for failure, but I also felt excited about the prospect of pursuing my dream and creating something that was truly my own. </p><p><u>It's been a few years since I started my business</u>, and it hasn't always been easy. There have been many ups and downs, but I have never regretted my decision to take the leap.

I was leaving behind everything I had ever known, my home, my friends, my family. I felt very unsure about what would happen next. But I knew that I had to do whatever it takes to protect my children. </p><p>We hastily packed our bags and made our way to the train station, hoping to catch the last train out of the city. The scene at the station was chaotic - there were crowds of people pushing and shoving, everyone trying to board the same train. Children were crying, their parents trying to calm them down. People were shouting and screaming, desperate to get out of the city before it was too late. As we finally managed to board the train, I couldn't help but feel a sense of relief mixed with uncertainty and guilt. The train journey was long and uncomfortable, but we finally reached the border and crossed into a neighboring country. We were lucky enough to have some friends who took us in and helped us settle down.</p><p>As time passed, I realized that I had made the right decision. Several months after we left, our city was hit by a massive missile attack and our house was destroyed.  Looking back on that difficult decision to flee the country, I am grateful for the safety and security we found in a new place. It wasn't an easy journey, but it was necessary to protect my kids and start a new life."

I also read a few articles about education abroad and found out what other students were saying about their experience. I even tried to consider job prospects in different countries.</p><p>I struggled to make a decision because my future was at stake. And, of course, I was afraid to suffer consequences of the wrong choice. It was difficult to imagine what living abroad would be like (taking into account the current situation regarding covid-19). Also, I knew I would have to start my life from the very beginning. And to top it off, I realised I would have to leave my friends and family behind.</p><p>After a great deal of thought I decided to seize this opportunity as it's better to regret what you have done than what you haven't. Now I'm planning to study in Canada.  Of course, the outcomes cannot be accurately predicted yet, but I hope I made the right decision. We'll see.

Since I absolutely love traveling, I always include a list of countries I'd like to visit. Like every year, I decided to write down a list of travel destinations.<p>I started surfing the internet, reading travel blogs, and watching videos on YouTube. One of the countries I came across was Cuba. I saw lots of pictures of its remarkable mountains, spectacular limestone hills, vast tobacco plantations, butter-soft beaches, lush green countryside, and colorful colonial cities. At some point, I realized there was something about Cuba that made me put it at the very top of my travel wish list.</p><p>Many travellers say that it's a truly unique place. The thing is, the country was isolated from the rest of the world for many years. And despite the fact that most restrictions were lifted some years ago, it hasn't changed a lot since then. Everyone says it seems to be lost in time, somewhere in the 1950's. I mean, people usually describe it as a place with salsa and rumba music playing everywhere, men smoking cigars and drinking rum, old American cars in the streets, and the beautiful colonial buildings with peeling paint in Old Havana. For me, it's really hard to believe that anything like that is possible in our modern world. So I want to experience it for myself. </p><p>At the moment, I don't know more than that, and I'm not planning to continue my research 'cause if I learn everything before visiting, there will be nothing left to discover when I go there one day. It won't be interesting. I know myself. So I really want to know more about this country, but I don't want to explore it from my couch."

On the one hand, almost all the words were clear; however, I wasn't able to sing along. The only line I could sing along to was: \"So tell me what you want, what you really, really want.\" To be honest, even now, I don't remember more than that. </p><p>Back then, I took it as a challenge. I found the lyrics and tried to read the first verse quickly. Then I attempted to sing along again. Although I could read the lyrics fast, I ran out of breath while trying to keep up with the vocalist. Every time, I ended up slurring my words like a drunk. </p><p>I decided not to give up. I told myself, 'Impossible is nothing.' I played the song over and over until I got tired of it. However, all my attempts to sing along with the first verse failed. Later, I realized I had made a fatal mistake by listening to that song on repeat. </p><p>The next day, I woke up with 'Wannabe' stuck in my head. I kept repeating those few lines from the verse over and over in my mind. I tried listening to other songs, but as soon as one song finished, 'Wannabe' would return, stuck on a loop in my head. I thought I was going to go crazy. </p><p>I must say, it's one of the most persistent earworms ever. Once it buries itself in your brain, it feels like you'd need surgery to remove it once and for all. Out of curiosity, I decided to google more about this girl group.

And it's <u>made of tinted glass, shiny steel  and concrete like almost all modern buildings nowadays</u>.</p><p>This building serves several purposes. On the bottom floor there's <u>a shopping centre, parking space</u> and something else. I don't remember what. <u>It also accommodates some cafes, numerous shops and offices</u>. There are <u>residential units</u> on top floors. Some of them are luxurious and really expensive. There's also <u>a restaurant with a panoramic view of the city</u>. It's a wonderful place for romantic dates.</p><p>I like this high-rise building because I perceive it as a symbol of progress in the city. Apart from that, it has become is a notable landmark, which attracts tourists."

But I also didn’t want to ruin the party by coughing everywhere or making someone else sick. I texted my friend and told her I couldn’t come. <p><p>So instead of going out, I spent the day at home.

I have a friend from work who is a serial traveller, and he has suitcases of all sizes and shapes. So I decided to borrow a suitcase from him. <p>The one that he gave to me was hardside luggage. This made me a little worried. These suitcases are very stylish, but prone to cracking and damage. And they are particularly vulnerable to damage during carriage on an airplane while being loaded and unloaded. They do not like being thrown around as many baggage handlers do. I was really afraid it would be scratched or damaged in any other way.</p><p>What I feared came upon me. My luggage was damaged during the flight. I didn't know how to tell my friend about it. I decided to buy exactly the same suitcase and return it to my friend, hoping he wouldn't notice the change. </p><p>I spent a few days searching for it, but this suitcase model was out of stock. So all I could do was tell my friend the truth about his suitcase and offer a replacement item. </p><p>When I told him the news, he was so upset that he didn't even manage to get the right look on his face. It appeared to be his favourite suitcase. But he wasn't angry with me ‘cause it wasn't my fault."

So I know what I'm talking about. I mean I have enough evidence to prove that she's an open person. Oh no, to say ‘open' is to say nothing. I think she's too open about her feelings. <p>If something is on her mind, she always lets people know about it whether they want it or not. For example, she tells people when something is bothering her, when something makes her feel excited, depressed or uncomfortable. She isn't afraid to tell people about painful or embarrassing situations that she experienced. And I know that she always says what she means, but not what other people want to hear. What's more, she posts a lot of personal details on Facebook and Instagram. I always joke that if we stopped being friends, I would still know as much information about her feelings and opinions as I do being her best friend and communicating with her every day. </p><p>On the one hand, I admire her ability to open up even to strangers ‘cause this helps her connect a lot more with other people. Her openness encourages other people to open up, and this helps to create a more open and trusting environment. Also, Ann is very easy to deal with, and it doesn't take much time to get to know her. When she is offended, she shows it and says that she's offended and explains why. When she's angry or embarrassed, she doesn't hide her emotions as well. Dealing with her doesn't require guesswork to understand what her opinion about something is, whether she's happy or not and why. You know, I find it really stressful and annoying to deal with people who have a blank and emotionless expression on their faces at all times.  I can't read anyone's mind. And I don't want to. </p><p>On the other hand, I don't think it's good to be an open book all the time. I always tell her that she should be selective about who she tells about herself. First of all, it can be dangerous for her. And this makes her vulnerable. Also, I think she discloses too much too soon. This turns some people off. I'm sure it would be much better if she kept self-disclosure to conversations with close people. And it seems to me her being too open is the main reason why she's still single. This drives some guys away and makes them lose interest. And I have to say that her openness isn't always appropriate. I mean that by expressing what she is feeling, she not only passes some of her emotion to others, but she also has to be ready to deal with the aftermath of that disclosure. But she isn't. "

I just couldn't leave it there. But my family wasn’t as excited as I was because they knew this meant more housework.

So, I had to promise to vacuum the floors, furniture, and carpets at least three times a week if I wanted to keep the kitten. </p><p>They even took pity on me and bought a vacuum cleaner specially designed for pet owners. It's a canister model, with the motor and dust collector connected to the vacuum head by a flexible hose. It’s a wheeled type and has really strong suction power, so cleaning doesn’t take much effort. It’s also compact and lightweight, making it easy to use. </p><p>I'm still keeping my promise, so I regularly vacuum all surfaces, using different attachments for different tasks. If it weren’t for this vacuum cleaner, the whole flat would be covered in cat hair because my tiny kitten grew into a very fluffy cat. </p><p>I’m really grateful that humanity invented this household device because it saves me a lot of time and lets me clean the whole flat quickly."

To tell the truth, it's very difficult to say who the main character is as whenever one seems to be taking the lead, they are killed off. </p><p>What I really like is that this TV series has a really compelling plot, and I was always on the edge of my seat waiting to see what would happen next. Also, it's really thought-provoking and shows life as it is. First of all, it contains a lot of violent scenes, and this is what reminds me that our life is not a bed of roses, but a constant struggle. Secondly, it shows that there are countless ways to reach the same goal. All the heroes strive for the same thing, but use absolutely different strategies to achieve the desired result. Another thing that I like is that it is dynamic and not excessively long. There are just 10 episodes in each of the six seasons. </p><p>I'm sure this TV series is worth a few hours of your time if you haven't watched it yet."

Then, she put up posters with these eye-opening facts all around the office to encourage people to switch to electronic documents whenever possible and to think twice before printing anything.

My dad explained the basic rules, like how to dribble, pass, and shoot, but after that, it was mostly me practicing on my own. I remember spending hours outside, trying to make the perfect shot. I also watched NBA games from time to time, and I’d try to copy moves from the players. <p>These days, I don’t play as often as I’d like to because I have so much on my plate with work and other responsibilities. But whenever I do get the chance, I really enjoy it. You're running, jumping, and always moving, so it’s a great workout. At the same time, it never feels like just exercise because you’re focused on the game. And it’s fun. </p><p>Another reason I love basketball is that it’s a great way to compete and spend time with friends. I’m a pretty competitive person, so I enjoy challenging myself and trying to win. But even when I lose, it’s still a good time. Playing with friends makes it even better because we get to joke around and have fun while playing. </p><p>So yeah, basketball is definitely my favorite sport. I just wish I had more time to play. "

An incredible performance is about to start!' It was a live broadcast, so I decided to tune in, thinking I’d just take a short break from work. <p>At first, there were just two acro dancers moving gracefully across the stage. For the first 30 seconds, nothing extraordinary happened. I was hugely disappointed and was about to close the video when, suddenly, one of the girls did a handstand and landed in a bridge with one leg up. Her toes were perfectly pointed, and her leg was as straight as an arrow. And that’s when the magic began. </p><p>The other girl, the top partner, quickly mounted her and did a handstand on top of her foot. I gasped in amazement. You should have seen the judges. They were staring at the girls, open-mouthed. Then, the base girl started lifting her other leg up to about 45 degrees. I couldn’t believe my eyes. What I saw completely defied the laws of physics. </p><p>They kept going with more mind-blowing double tricks, insane partner handstands, and other gravity-defying acrobatic moves. One of the judges kept repeating, 'How is this even possible?' while the others watched in wide-eyed amazement. The performance was so incredible that I couldn't take my eyes off the stage. And I couldn’t help but watch it again and again. I was completely blown away. </p><p> To be honest, it's hard to put this experience into words - other than OMG, OMG, OMG!

It came into effect just a few years ago, which is pretty recent for a law. <p>I think this ban is one of the smartest laws ever passed. You know, if someone chooses to damage their health, that’s their right. I’m fine with that. But it's not fair for non-smokers to inhale tobacco smoke against their will just because smokers feel like lighting up wherever they please. So I’m happy that this ban keeps non-smokers away from secondhand smoke, which prevents a range of health issues like respiratory diseases, nausea, and headaches. It has also helped discourage smoking in general. Kids tend to copy what they see adults doing, so the less they see people smoking in public, the lower the chances they’ll pick up the habit themselves. </p><p>All in all, it’s a law that has done a lot of good. But I would take this law even further. I believe there should be stricter fines for littering cigarette butts, since many smokers still toss them on the ground without a second thought. Cigarette butts are non-biodegradable, and they pollute the soil, clog water systems, and leach dangerous chemicals into the environment. If the government really wants to tackle smoking-related problems, they should address this issue as well. "

He is one of the greatest players of all time. Football experts compare him to the legendary Maradona. And I'm talking about <u>Lionel Messi</u>. He started making headlines many years ago, and he's still very popular. <p>Messi was born in a small town in Argentina. He was just 5 when he started playing football. When he was a teenager, agents from Barcelona saw his talent, and he moved to Spain. He became one of the youngest players in Barcelona. By the way, in 2021, he announced that he was leaving Barcelona after 21 years of playing for the club (the only club he had played for at that time) 'cause the club said it could no longer afford to pay. It was very emotional, and I even started crying when I saw him crying at his farewell press conference. After that, he played for Paris Saint-Germain for two seasons, and now he plays for Inter Miami in the USA. <p></p>He has had a lot of extraordinary achievements and won a lot of trophies so far. For example, in 2022, he won the World Cup with Argentina and was named the best player of the tournament. He also won multiple European Champions League titles and the World Club Championship with Barcelona. What's more, he's Argentina's all-time leading goalscorer. </p><p>I love to watch him playing, especially when he scores his beautiful goals from quick counterattacks. He is undoubtedly a natural talent. You know, the ball seems to be glued to his foot. He is a master at reading the game, and he's very quick. Everyone calls him the greatest dribbler of his generation. I particularly like when he dribbles at high speed, then he suddenly slows down, waits for the defender to get closer to him, then accelerates in the opposite direction. It doesn't matter how many defenders try to stop him, it's simply impossible. What's interesting is that everyone knows this trick, but he does it again and again, and defenders always go for that. I can't help admiring Messi because he does things that people talk about years later."

But last Friday, I came home from work, collapsed on the sofa, and passed out. When I woke up on Saturday morning, I realized I needed a full day of doing nothing to reboot my system. I was on the verge of burnout. So, I decided to visit a spa center. <p>I went alone because I didn’t want to talk to anyone. If I had invited my friends, I would have had to engage in conversations, which would have drained all my energy. So, I kept my plan to myself. </p><p>I spent some time in a steam room, then moved to a sauna with dry herbal steam. I swam in a pool and even stepped into a snow room once. Between sauna sessions, I sipped herbal tea. </p><p>But what I enjoyed the most was the Japanese bath. There were two hot tubs (one at 45C and the other at 40C) plus a swimming pool with water at 6-8C. First, I sat in the hotter tub for about three minutes, then moved to the second one. After that, I plunged into the cold water before returning to the hot tub. I repeated this cycle several times. By the end, I felt like I was born again.    "

He promised that we would spend the whole day outside the following weekend. And we did. <p>My husband suggested going for a bike ride through the countryside. I agreed, even though I hadn’t ridden a bicycle since childhood. So, we rented two bikes, which didn’t cost much, and set off for our country house, which is in a beautiful area near a coniferous forest. Funnily enough, we had only ever had barbecue parties in the garden there and had never really explored the nature around us. </p><p>We took some food because we weren’t sure if we would be back quickly or spend the whole day cycling. We also brought a navigator to avoid getting lost in the middle of nowhere. At first, I rode at a snail’s pace, focusing entirely on balancing and steering. Of course, that meant I couldn’t really appreciate the scenery. But it was fun. It felt a bit like being a kid again. </p><p>Soon, I got the hang of it and started riding confidently. We passed cows grazing in green fields, ducks hiding in the grass, and beautiful wildflowers with butterflies fluttering around them. We often stopped to take photos and soak in the stunning views. Overall, it wasn’t a strenuous ride. Whenever we felt tired, we simply wheeled our bikes along.</p><p>By evening, we returned to our starting point and headed home. We were physically tired, but it helped me recharge my batteries, and it was fun."

					"text": "<arrow>Last year <u>while I was on holiday in Greece</u>,  I decided  to try oysters for the first time. I really wanted to taste them as there were so many people who loved them and the same number of people who hated them. So, on the one hand,  I wanted to form my own opinion on this type of seafood. On the other, I was a bit afraid. The place we stayed in was right by the sea, so my friends persuaded me this was the best opportunity to duly appreciate the taste of oysters as they were supposed to be really fresh there.<p>We went to <u>a seafood restaurant</u> and ordered a large plate of oysters. Although they were expensive, I thought there wouldn't be a better chance in the near future, so I was determined to taste them come what may.</p><p>My friends started eating, saying every other second how <u>delicious</u> they were. I plucked up my courage, took the first oyster and slurped it before I changed my mind.</p><p>When my mouth was filled with slime, I had to swallow this slippery liquid just because there were many people around. But <u>if I had been at home, I would have spitted it out immediately as the texture was just horrible</u>. </p><p>A few minutes later I thought, okay, one more try. I grabbed another one, not expecting much, but somehow, it actually tasted good. Then I had a third. And before I knew it, I’d basically eaten the whole plate. Now, Now, anytime I get the chance, I order oysters without a second thought."

Frankly speaking, I don't remember the storyline in detail, but I remember that we had one hour to escape the room to avoid being caught and imprisoned.</p><p>The room, in which we were locked, was packed with different stuff such as books, maps, fedoras, magnets, sticky notes, watches, old wigs, compasses, lamps, board games, playing cards. The puzzles were really challenging and intriguing. </p><p>It was real fun. We were frantically searching for clues. Some of them involved solving riddles, putting items in the correct order, or finding a set of objects hidden in the room. What I will never forget is that there was a broken clock and for a long time we couldn't figure out that we had to pay attention to the time it stopped on. By the way, it appeared to be the last clue. So we even thought we would sink with the ship, but then one us had a brainwave and we survived in the last minute.</p><p>It was really unusual an activity for all of us as <u>we hadn't done anything like that before</u>.

Like, we can start chatting about something random and end up discussing the meaning of life. So one day, we found this online course about karma and thought, ‘Why not try it?’ <p>It turned out to be super cool. The course explained that everything you do has some kind of effect, and even small actions can come back to you later, in good or bad ways. It really made us think differently about a lot of things. Now, whenever something good or bad happens, we kind of sit down and go, ‘Okay, what could’ve caused this? What did we do that maybe led to this?’ It really makes us reflect on our behavior. </p><p>What I really enjoy about learning about karma with my friend is how much it’s brought us closer. It’s not the kind of thing you can talk about with just anyone. Most people would probably think you’re a bit strange if you start discussing karma, energy, or anything spiritual. They might not say it, but you can see it on their face. But with my friend, it’s completely different. We can talk about these things without feeling judged, and that’s what makes it so special. Honestly, it feels like we’re learning and growing together, and that makes the whole experience feel so much more meaningful. I think that’s what makes our friendship so great.  We’re constantly discovering new things together, and that brings us even closer."

					"text": "<arrow>Last summer, my friend suggested going for a bike ride in the countryside. I agreed, even though I hadn’t ridden a bike since I was a kid. One day, we rented two bikes and headed to my friend’s country house. It’s in a really beautiful area near a big forest. And it’s just about an hour’s drive from where I live. The funny thing is, we’d been to the house so many times but only ever had barbecue parties in the garden. We’d never actually explored the nature around it. <p>We packed some food because we weren’t sure if we’d be back quickly or spend the whole day out. We also brought a navigator, just in case we got lost in the middle of nowhere. At first, I was super slow - I was focused on just balancing and steering, so I didn’t really notice the scenery. But it was still fun and kind of reminded me of being a kid again.</p><p>After a while, I got used to it and started riding more confidently. The countryside was amazing. There were cows grazing in the fields, ducks hiding in the grass, and wildflowers everywhere. I stopped a lot to take photos and enjoy the view. The ride wasn’t hard at all. Whenever we got tired, we just walked our bikes and soaked in the peaceful surroundings. </p><p>By evening, we went back to the house and then home. We were tired but happy. Honestly, it was such a refreshing experience. It made me feel like a kid again, bringing back those carefree memories from childhood. Plus, it was a great break from my daily routine. I didn’t think about work or any problems the whole time."

					"text": "Last Sunday, I went to the village to visit my grandparents. During the pandemic, I didn’t visit them at all because I was afraid to infect them. I missed them very much. My grandpa even said he was more afraid to die of loneliness than of coronavirus. So since the pandemic, I’ve been visiting them more often to make up for the time we lost even though it takes me 5 hours to get there. <p>My grandparents live in a quiet and beautiful place by the river. They have a cozy house with a big garden. There are lots of flowers, and sometimes orchids bloom too. You know, being there is like travelling back in time. Everything reminds me of my carefree childhood: my toys, old CDs, my bicycle. It feels like you step into another world. All the walls are still covered with old wallpaper. My grandmother doesn’t allow us to remove it, and she refuses to get their house refurbished because she wants to keep all their memories alive. She says they both love their 50-year-old chairs and armchairs, their old wooden table in the kitchen, paintings, clay pots, old pictures, and lots of things they bought when they were young. </p><p>You know, I think she’s right. There’s something special about this old house. It’s a magical place, and I really love spending time there. When I visit, I enjoy going fishing and exploring the countryside during the day. In the evenings, I watch the sunset from the backyard. I drink hot tea and eat cinnamon buns. My grandmother always bakes them when I come because she knows how much I love them. If I didn't have so much on my plate and if the trip didn't take so long, I would visit them more often."

You know, it is believed your wish will come true if you blow out all the candles in a single puff. </p><p>This photo is what people see first when they come to my parents' place. <u>I don't remember who took it because I was too young</u> and I don't remember who exactly was invited to the party. In any case, <u>this must have been one of my relatives</u> that took the photo as the photo doesn't look professional, so <u>I doubt it was taken by a photographer</u>. </p><p><u>This shot is truly something to be treasured</u> as, first of all, <u>it reminds of my childhood</u> every time I look at it. Also, <u>this is one of the few photos where the whole family is depicted and all of us look genuinely happy</u>.

For this reason, I remember all those 2 or 3 cases when I didn't delete a picture taken by another person. <p>I think I'll describe one close-up which drew the most likes and comments on Facebook and Instagram recently. It sounds silly to care about something as small as a like on a picture, but it's our reality. To tell the truth, I didn't expect that photo to break the Internet but it did.</p><p>Several weeks ago I came home after my friend's birthday party. I had a very beautiful makeup. Dark smoky eyes and glossy lips… I decided such heavenly beauty had to be captured forever, so I took my selfie stick and started experimenting. But I didn't like the pics. My mom wanted me to help her about the house, so she decided to speed up the process and help me get a beautiful picture. </p><p>She took pictures at eye level and from a higher angle to exaggerate the size of my eyes and avoid a double chin in a picture. She took hundreds of them as my pictures never come out perfect after the first snapshot. Then we picked the best one, I used some filters to manipulate the image, you know, to erase blemishes…such things. After that I cropped the image so that nobody could see the background and immediately uploaded it to Facebook and Instagram, awaiting for likes and comments.</p><p>Frankly speaking, I really liked the way I looked because I was genuinely happy in the picture and looked simply amazing on that day. So, probably,  even if my friends hadn't liked this pic so much, it would, anyway, be one of my favourite ones.</p>"

					"text": "<arrow>I think that my best friend Ann is a rare example of a person who expresses her feelings freely. We've been friends for many years, and I see her almost every day. So I know what I'm talking about. I mean I have enough evidence to prove that she's an open person. Oh no, to say ‘open' is to say nothing. I think she's too open about her feelings. <p>If something is on her mind, she always lets people know about it whether they want it or not. For example, she tells people when something is bothering her, when something makes her feel excited, depressed or uncomfortable. She isn't afraid to tell people about painful or embarrassing situations that she experienced. And I know that she always says what she means, but not what other people want to hear. What's more, she posts a lot of personal details on Facebook and Instagram. I always joke that if we stopped being friends, I would still know as much information about her feelings and opinions as I do being her best friend and communicating with her every day. </p><p>On the one hand, I admire her ability to open up even to strangers ‘cause this helps her connect a lot more with other people. Her openness encourages other people to open up, and this helps to create a more open and trusting environment. Also, Ann is very easy to deal with, and it doesn't take much time to get to know her. When she is offended, she shows it and says that she's offended and explains why. When she's angry or embarrassed, she doesn't hide her emotions as well. Dealing with her doesn't require guesswork to understand what her opinion about something is, whether she's happy or not and why. You know, I find it really stressful and annoying to deal with people who have a blank and emotionless expression on their faces at all times.  I can't read anyone's mind. And I don't want to. </p><p>On the other hand, I don't think it's good to be an open book all the time. I always tell her that she should be selective about who she tells about herself. First of all, it can be dangerous for her. And this makes her vulnerable. Also, I think she discloses too much too soon. This turns some people off. I'm sure it would be much better if she kept self-disclosure to conversations with close people. And it seems to me her being too open is the main reason why she's still single. This drives some guys away and makes them lose interest. And I have to say that her openness isn't always appropriate. I mean that by expressing what she is feeling, she not only passes some of her emotion to others, but she also has to be ready to deal with the aftermath of that disclosure. But she isn't. "

My friend is pretty much the same, so we often decide to do things at the same time. And it usually helps us not to flake. <p>One of the best decisions we made together was to finally start going to the gym. We’d both been talking about it for ages. You know, the usual ‘We should get healthier,’ ‘We should exercise more,’ kind of thing, but neither of us was actually doing anything about it. </p><p>Then one day, we just sat down and said, ‘OK, let’s do this. Let’s pick a gym, choose the days, and go together.’ I think if it had just been me, I probably would’ve signed up, gone once or twice, and then stopped. But knowing that my friend was doing it too made me feel more motivated. <p></p>We chose a gym near both our homes, agreed to go every Monday and Thursday after work, and even made a shared playlist to keep us going. At first, it was tough, (I mean, sore muscles, early alarms), but we kept showing up because we didn’t want to let each other down. </p><p>What made it interesting was how it slowly became part of our routine. We started feeling better, sleeping better, even eating better without really planning to. We actually looked forward to those gym sessions, because it wasn’t just about working out, it was also about catching up and laughing about how unfit we were at first. So, deciding to go to the gym together made all the difference. It wasn’t just about fitness. It was about support and sticking to something because you’re not doing it alone. "

And my mom seems to be trying to take FULL advantage of this 'cause she grows all vegetables that don't require a lot of space such as tomatoes and peppers, dwarf varieties of cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli, beans, cucumbers, peas, to name but a few. Also, she grows greens such as lettuce, spinach, arugula, mustard green, chard, endive leaf, and even Chinese cabbage. Oh, I nearly forgot to mention herbs. She grows parsley, chives, cilantro, mint, rosemary, basil. By the way, basil is said to be hard to grow, but the basil that my mom grows is picture-perfect. She always manages to grow big bushy basil plants. Thanks to my mom, my parents have fresh vegetables for salads, soups, stews, omelets, noodles, and various meat and egg dishes almost all year round. </p><p>My mom's vegetable garden is her pride. There are colorful pots, decorative barrels, urns, and modern designer planters. She spends a lot of time taking care of her plants. I'm sure caring for a living thing gives her a purpose 'cause in a sense, having plants is like having pets. Plus, it's a great way to relax and bring a touch of nature inside. "

They joked they would buy one tenth of a computer for me. They weren't as excited about it as I was, so they decided that if they couldn't afford to buy a computer, they would, at least, find some creative way to give cash so that I would remember it for a long time. They gave me a huge bouquet of flowers that were made from banknotes. They folded banknotes so that they resembled buds.</p><p>To be honest, I thought they would give me a white boring envelope with cash. Can you imagine how surprised I was when I saw this bouquet. <u>My jaw dropped in amazement</u>. I'm not joking. They managed to kill two birds with one stone.

There were vendors shouting to attract customers, music playing, and people talking and negotiating prices. </p><p>As I walked through the market, I heard a loud noise and turned to see a vendor using a megaphone. The sound was so loud that it was overwhelming and I could feel a ringing in my ears, like I was at a concert. I tried to get away from the noise as fast as I could, but it seemed to follow me no matter where I went. </p><p>I walked through the rows of stalls, taking in the sights and smells of the fresh produce and handmade crafts. I stopped to chat with some of the vendors and learned about their products and where they were from. I eventually found a stall that sold handmade pottery and decided to buy a small vase as a gift for a friend. The vendor and I negotiated the price, and I paid for the vase using some of the local currency I had exchanged before my trip. </p><p>Overall, I really enjoyed my visit to the noisy market. It was a vibrant, exciting place full of interesting people and products. In my opinion, the noise was sometimes unbearable, but it was definitely a key part of the market's energy and atmosphere. And the sounds of the market were overwhelming at first, but I quickly became accustomed to the noise and began to enjoy the lively atmosphere. Now I can safely say that it's by far the noisiest place I have ever visited."

					"text": "<arrow>In my opinion, by far the most stylish person I've ever met in person is my childhood friend Helen. She's a beginner fashion stylist although she doesn't have a degree in fashion. She's just naturally good at picking and pairing the right clothes that match perfectly together. She understands which colours and shapes look good on people, and which don't. She knows exactly what is ideal for her body type. Due to this, everything she wears just looks like it was made precisely for her body. Helen believes one shouldn't stick to one type of style 'cause adhering to rules can stifle a person's creativity and individuality. <p>As far as I can judge, most of the time she wears casual clothes such as jeans, comfortable T-shirts, sneakers, flat boots.  But as I've said before she has an eye for style. So she always looks casual but stylish. For example, if dresses all in black, she puts on a pair of white shoes. She likes to pair skinny pants with loose-fitting tops. If we go to a party, she dresses up her casual outfits with some trendy accessories such as a bangle bracelet and a long necklace. If it's a denim shirt, she rolls up her sleeves to give it a carefree vibe. It's amazing how chooses clothes that can be easily mixed and matched together. </p><p>Good looks are important for her to create a good first impression on her potential clients. But I think that even if she weren't a fashion stylist, she would still have stylish outfits 'cause it's a way for her to express herself without saying a word, a way to show people who she really is.

				{
					"text": "<arrow>To my mind, <u>driving a car</u> is an invaluable skill that everyone should learn. And this is the skill that I can teach others easily ‘cause I have over 10 years of driving experience. What's more, everyone says I'm cut out to be a good teacher. So, yeah, I think I can teach anyone how to drive safely and confidently. <p>I know exactly that I won't act like my father who taught me to drive many years ago. His method of teaching was effective, but I don't think it will work for everyone. I wish the learning process had been less stressful back then. So I will try not to turn into  the ‘sink or swim' type of a teacher like my dad. Just imagine, he took me on X Avenue, one of the busiest roads in the city. My spine stiffened, my eyes popped and my face turned red like in the episode of ‘Tom and Jerry' in which Tom gets his claws smashed by a hammer. I was really scared. Moreover, my father was constantly yelling at me and giving instructions. I'm sure that Apollo astronauts received fewer commands from mission control than I did from my father. So you can imagine… back in the day when I was 18, I didn't really appreciate the lessons. </p><p>So if I teach someone to drive, I will act differently. At least, I hope I will. <u>I will break down the process into a series of steps. First, we'll practice in a simulated environment and focus on mastering one or two functions, say, steering and speed calibration. Then I will make my student repeat each step until they get it right before leading them headlong into ‘real' traffic conditions. I will explain to them what to do and what mistakes to avoid. And I'm sure that one day my student will drive like a pro. </p><p>And when this happens, my student will feel what real freedom is ‘cause this person, whoever this person is, will no longer have to catch the bus, wait for a taxi or ask somebody to give them a lift and completely depend on others. I can say without any exaggeration that this skill will improve anyone's life in countless ways."

At first glance, the scene seemed peaceful, and it showed that humanity tamed nature as it yields the necessities we need to live. In the the far distance I could make out the outline of majestic mountains. There were dark clouds which gathered over the mountain tops. And they seemed to be slowly moving towards me. I think the artist skillfully managed to capture this  contrast. </p><p>I don't know what message the artist wanted to deliver, but for me it was like a silent reminder that humanity is small and impotent in front of raging rivers, violent storms, and other natural phenomena.

One of the things he told me was that he was planning to withdraw all the money from his savings account and invest it in cryptocurrency. Just imagine, all his life savings... He said it was the best time to invest 'cause the price of bitcoin and several other leading cryptocurrencies had suffered huge falls recently, so the price of bitcoin plunged to about 90000 dollars, but some analysts are predicting the price of bitcoin could hit 250000 dollars by the end of the next year.  And there are a lot of new coins that he thinks will make a good investment as well.  One more reason why he said cryptocurrency could make a good investment is that everyone says cryptocurrency is the future 'currency of the internet' and ultimate store of wealth. What's more, transactions are fast, digital, secure and worldwide, which allows the maintenance of records without risk of data being pirated. </p><p>To say I was shocked was to say nothing. I thought it was the worst decision he made in his entire life. I told him (and, by the way, this is what all cryptocurrency experts recommend doing) that if I were him, I wouldn't invest more than I can afford to lose, and that I wouldn't invest all my life savings. Also, I told him that he should be in it for a long time before he could gain enough knowledge to be able to manage risks and make a plan or strategy. People who hardly know anything about it risk losing all their money. Finally, I told him a couple of stories of bitcoin millionaires and losses. For instance, I told him a sad story of some guy who accidentally threw away 7500 bitcoins when he got rid of an old laptop hard drive. He bought them when they were worth 1 dollar. And they are worth over 600 million dollars today. He now wants to dig up his local rubbish tip, hoping to find the old drive. But you should know my friend. He is stubborn as hell. He said that nothing could make him change his mind. "

Her mom told her that she couldn't have the doll and that if she wanted something, she had to ask. </p><p>The girl's chin dropped to her chest. She crossed her arms. And she just stood there, pouting her lips and staring angrily at her mother. Her mom said politely that she was going to leave the store and suggested the little girl follow her. </p><p>Instead of obeying her mom, the girl started to cry, and then she fell on the floor in a full blown tantrum. She was screaming at the top of her lungs. It was so loud that some customers started giving the child's mom dirty looks. Others started watching the show with much interest. Workers of the toy shop continued acting like they didn't care. I think they were used to such scenes. </p><p>The woman told her daughter to stop once, which obviously didn't work. So she put her stuff in the cart and threw herself down on the ground too, yelling and faking a hissy fit. The little girl stopped and was just like 'What?' The little girl stopped crying almost immediately. The mom got up, brushed herself off, and left the store with her daughter.  I was a little annoyed when the show started, but when they were leaving the store, I couldn't help but laugh. "

We usually waited for our class to start in the locker room, pretending to be glued to our phones not noticing one another. Once I decided to start a conversation. I must say this was my best decision ever. After that we often made small talk. Some weeks later we exchanged telephone numbers and started calling and texting each other from time to time. It turned out we had a lot in common, and I really enjoyed talking to her. We communicated more and more frequently, went to the park and to the cinema together. It was inevitable that we became best friends. And since that time we've been inseparable.</p><p>To be honest, it doesn't really matter what we do as long as we are together. I've noticed recently that the older we get, the more we like to just sit around and talk instead of hanging around the city all day.

In addition, <u>I enjoyed doing crossword puzzles, that's why when I was told to do that at the lesson, I was really glad</u>. At the end of the lesson, we got a challenging task which was <u>to compose spooky stories in English</u>. <u>I am fond of creative writing, so it was a real pleasure for me when I got that task</u>. Then every student read their story aloud. <u>The teacher praised us from time to time, therefore our language confidence significantly increased</u>, and I bet everybody was convinced that their story was a masterpiece. </p><p>To my mind, that lesson was special because <u>I had a wonderful opportunity to develop my communication and writing skills and got a good understanding of tricky grammatical structures</u>. Moreover, it's worth mentioning that <u>it was only after this  lesson that I started feeling an overwhelming desire to learn English</u>. <u>Every minute of the lesson was incredibly interesting to me</u>.

					"text": "<arrow>The person who once persuaded me to do something really important was my father. I’m sure that if it weren’t for him, I would have made a very different choice and maybe even regretted it later. He has always been supportive, but there was one moment when he didn’t just support me. He actually talked me out of quitting something I cared about. <p>When I was 14, like many teenagers, I did sports and dreamed of becoming a professional athlete. I had trained for a whole year to compete in a national championship. It was a big deal because it only happened once a year. But when the day finally came, I failed to win. I was really disappointed and started thinking I wasn’t good enough. I even made up my mind to quit sports altogether. </p><p>After a few missed training sessions, my father noticed something was wrong. He asked me what was going on, and I told him everything. That’s when he had a serious conversation with me. He didn’t just say, 'Don’t worry' or 'You’ll do better next time.' Instead, he gave me examples, like Thomas Edison failing many times before inventing the light bulb. He said, 'If you give up now, you’ll never know what you’re really capable of.' </p><p>He persuaded me to give it another shot, to see that one failure didn’t mean the end of the road. He reminded me that the bigger the dream, the more setbacks you might face — and that’s completely normal. </p><p>His words really stuck with me. I decided not to quit and trained even harder. The following year, I competed again. And this time, I actually won the championship. That moment became a turning point for me. And now, whenever I feel like giving up, I remember how my dad persuaded me to keep going. And I try again."

I used to be a very lazy girl who loved fast food and hated sports. And at that time I was so slim that I didn't even think that one day being overweight would become my number one problem. When I realised that I'd put on X kilos, I decided to lose weight and get fit, no matter what. <p>The very first thing that I did was buy smart scales and download the accompanying app. Then I set a weight loss goal in the settings of the app. So my goal was kind of visualized. It was no longer an idea in my mind. It turned into a point on a line graph. Every morning I stepped on the scale, my information was recorded and sent to the app. The app tracked my progress in charts, and I saw where I was in terms of meeting my target. This motivated me in ways that simply writing down my weight couldn't. And this really helped me not to give up. </p><p>Of course, measuring my weight wasn't the only thing that I did to achieve my goal. <u>I went  jogging in the mornings and I walked in the evenings</u>. Also, <u>I ditched junk food and stopped buying snacks</u>, which I couldn't live without. <u>I started sticking to a diet</u>. You know, no sweets, no rice, no cheeseburgers and French fries. Nothing. Only salads, vegetables, fruits and plenty of fluids. <u>I ate only healthy food and drank a lot of water daily</u>. <u>I cooked foods in healthier ways such as boiling, baking and stewing</u>. I read somewhere that it is better to have a few light meals instead of one main meal. So I followed this advice too. I continued this practice for six straight months. As a result, I lost more than X kilograms. </p><p>Now I'm not only as slim as I used to be, but I'm also fit enough. And I'm genuinely proud of my achievement. I should say <u>it was hard to change my habits, my diet and my lifestyle, and at some point I was about to give up because all those activities were really time consuming</u>. But I didn't. <u>You can't even imagine how much effort I put in achieving this result</u>. <u>I would even say I was fighting the battle of my life</u>. And I won."

I was about to invest a substantial amount of money into Ethereum when my friend who's into cryptocurrencies told me the price would drop to $700 or $800. To be honest, I doubted it could go any lower 'cause I learned that $1000 was Ethereum's new 2-year low.

To cut a long story short, I bought nothing. </p><p>You know, I'm still feeling frustrated 'cause I think I missed an insanely good investment opportunity.

I live in a big city, and there are many shops here, but most of them are not worth visiting because they offer a poor range of goods, bad service, and high prices. This hypermarket, on the other hand, really changed the way I do my shopping.<p>Before it opened, I used to go to another big-box store on the other side of the city. It had everything I needed, but getting there and back took too much time. Now, this new shop is much closer, and I go there at least once or twice a week. It's located on the outskirts of the city, but it's really convenient for me.</p><p>Like most hypermarkets, it sells all kinds of goods from everyday essentials like toothpaste and snacks to electronics and household appliances. I love how well-organised everything is. The product categories are easy to navigate, and complementary items are placed close together, which saves me time and effort.</p><p>What makes me go there regularly is the great variety of products and low prices. For example, I once bought a T-shirt for just $2, which would have cost over $5 anywhere else. I also save a lot by buying in bulk, such as bottled water, cleaning supplies, and kitchen paper.</p><p>Another great thing is that the shop is open 24 by 7. So I usually go there on weekday evenings after work, which means I don’t have to spend my weekends shopping. Instead, I can relax or spend time with my friends and family.</p><p>Overall, this is the shop I go to most often because it's affordable, convenient, and helps me save both time and money."

					"text": "<arrow>The comedy which made me laugh throughout the movie until the very end is <u>Bad Boys For Life</u>. I watched it at the cinema shortly before the coronavirus outbreak. And, by the way, I haven't been to the cinema since that time. <p>It's a conventional cop movie. The plot is somewhat daft and predictable, but the movie stars Will Smith and Martin Lawrence who are comedy geniuses and therefore they can turn any movie into a belly-laugh comedy. In Bad Boys For Life, Will Smith's Mike and Martin Larence's Markus are still Miami detectives. I'm saying ‘still' as it's the third film in a trilogy. So they're a little older, of course. Marcus has become a grandfather and wants to retire. But Isabel Aretas, widow of cartel kingpin Benito, escapes from a Mexican prison and sends her son Armando to Miami to assassinate the people responsible for his father's arrest and eventual death in prison. Isabel demands that Armando kill Miami detective Mike Lowrey last. So the two detectives re-unite one last time to investigate a string of murders tied to Mike's  past. <p><p>I laughed for two straight hours. The funny bits are funny. The serious bits are even funnier. I think it's a combination of situation, sharp jokes, and actors' performance that make it absolutely uproarious. Just look at the expressions on Martin Larence's face, and you'll laugh hysterically. Lawrence is a brilliant actor who can tell an entire story on his face in one reaction shot. Also, the movie is packed with funny moments. I'll describe my favourite one. We see Mike and Marcus flying at unbelievable velocity, and pulling off some insane driving stunts as Mike makes his way to their final destination. And even though Mike drives his Porsche recklessly, the car isn't even scratched. But then he parks the car, Martin Lawrence's Markus opens the door and ruins it by whacking it into a hydrant. It's silly, but it evokes explosive laughter. And I think another reason why the movie is truly one of the best comedies ever made is that the jokes are fresh and ‘in the moment'. Many jokes are relatable. I mean everyone can recognise themselves."

Also, watching sports events of any kind has never been my priority on a trip. And I knew it would be hard to make myself sit down next to my spouse and watch Thai fights for about two hours. But I wanted to please my husband ‘cause I thought it would give me an opportunity to bond with him. So I thought the benefits would be well worth making the effort. </p><p>As it turned out, we actually got tickets for the final day of a local boxing championship. That evening, they held the final fights in different weight categories, so we got to watch six matches in a row. The boxing arena was grand, and we were sitting right by the ring. I could even see the fighters' facial expressions. Now I know what a knockout really looks like. I should say it was painful to watch, especially taking into account the fact that some of the fighters looked like kids. But my husband was really excited, and he appreciated me joining him and watching the fights. </p><p>So overall, it was a worthwhile experience ‘cause it helped us strengthen the family bonds.

It's located <u>pretty far from the city centre</u>, which might seem a serious obstacle for people willing to visit it regularly. Nevertheless, it's very popular with city dwellers, and nobody has ever complained about its location as there are a number of  things that make this swimming pool easily the best pool in the city.<p>First of all, <u>it has ample parking space for all the visitors</u>. This means you don't have to come much earlier to find where to park your car. Also, <u>the facility is new and clean</u>. <u>There are spacious locker rooms</u>, so you don't feel cramped and  <u>don't have to navigate through wet bodies to collect your belongings</u>. What's surprising is that <u>there are showers with towels, shampoos and conditioners, but the memberships aren't pricy</u>. The pool is really large, so, thank God, <u>even during peak times you don't share a lane with more than 3 people</u>. Several lanes on one side of the pool are used by <u>professional swimmers</u>, several lanes on the other side are occupied by <u>elderly people, pregnant women and beginners</u>. All the other lanes are used by <u>men and women who swim for fitness</u>. You know, all those people who swim fast and overtake each other. I'm really afraid of such swimmers as I have to share a lane with them. Oh, I nearly forgot. <u>There's a gigantic water play space for children</u> where they are looked after by the staff of the pool, while their parents are swimming. I'm sure this is one of the reasons which make people choose this very pool. Also, I can't help mentioning that <u>the water is always warm enough for comfortable swimming, and after swimming you can enjoy spa treatments</u>. One more important thing that appeals to many people (and I'm not an exception) is that </u>it's open from 6 a.m. to 11 p.m.</u>, which means that all people have an opportunity to visit it regardless of how early they start their working day or how late they finish it."

You can use <u>weight machines</u> and <u>free weights such as barbells and dumbbells</u>. There are <u>cardio machines such as a treadmill and an elliptical trainer</u>.  <u>The gym also allows a small space for stretching</u>. But, in my opinion, it doesn't really matter how big or small a gym is as long as you have enough motivation to go there regularly and do some exercises. I don't understand those people who think that doing crunches on a big blue ball is better than doing them on a floor, or a bench. I think that those who wait until they can afford to buy a pricy membership in a modern gym just try to find an excuse to justify their laziness. </p><p><u>This gym is very popular and is often too crowded as, first of all, it offers memberships that fit any budget</u> and, as I've said before, it's the only gym in the district. It is definitely more popular with men than with women as women usually dislike lifting weights. In general, there are different categories of people there. I see both <u>beginners and seasoned exercisers, even competitive athletes</u>. You can see those who frantically lift weights and see nothing around.  Also, <u>there are those people come to the gym religiously every day only to talk, roam around, use the same weight forever, grab on their cell phones, or some other practice that has nothing to do with staying focused on their training</u>. </p><p>In any case, <u>this gym is very important for our city (and I like it)  as it helps to get more people involved in sport</u> and helps people save their time 'cause they don't need to go to the other end of the city to work out.

Then each contestant is required to sing in front of the judges and the live audience. In each of the shows, the contestants with the lowest number of viewer votes are eliminated.

And he was offered a relocation package, so he decided to work abroad for at least a year. He asked me to look after his apartment. So from time to time, like once a week or once a fortnight, I go to his place to make sure everything's ok. <u>There is remote control heating, lighting, and sound systems, floor heating and cooling, automatic blinds</u>. Plus, there are 2 or 3 surveillance cameras inside. So I wouldn't have to visit it so often if there weren't houseplants that my friends likes so much. They are like his pets. So they have to be taken good care of. <p>It's <u>a very spacious 3 bedroom flat in a newly-build block of flats</u>. What I like the most about it is <u>big floor-to-ceiling windows that let a lot of natural light in</u>. There are some elements of a loft style such as massive oak planks, concrete walls, marble panels and some other things made of natural stone glass and steel</u>. There is <u>a surrounding sound system all through the apartment</u>. There are both an eat-in kitchen and a formal dining room, walk-in closets and a bedroom complete with whirlpool tubs and separate showers, a small laundry room, media room and home office</u>. </p><p>I like to visit it, but I don't think I would like to live in such a flat. First of all, <u>it's too big to clean without using a cleaning service or having a full-time cleaner</u>. And that's quite expensive, I think. Also, <u>you pay more in utilities to heat and cool those extra rooms, and you spend more on furnishings to fill them up</u>. And, to be honest, <u>I don't see any point in paying ALL the time for a lot of space I will only use SOME of the time</u>. What's more, <u>it doesn't feel like home</u>. And <u>I don't want to live in a flat that is Pinterest-perfect and looks like a museum</u>. In my opinion, <u>a flat shouldn't be as perfect or sterile as a builder's model home</u>.

On the one hand, there was nothing special, by the way, very little furniture, but all the elements together created a truly cohesive look.  There was <u>a lot of original decor</u>. I thought she'd spent a fortune on it. You can only imagine how surprised I was to find out that she made all this decor herself using twigs, ropes, mason jars and other stuff like that. I also liked <u>floor-to-ceiling windows that let a lot of natural light in and a stunning panoramic view of the city</u>.

					"text": "<arrow>This happened to me last year. I ordered a book online as a birthday gift for my sister. Her birthday was the next day, so I needed the book to arrive on time. The price on the website was 800 pesos, which seemed fair, so I placed the order using cash on delivery.<p>But when the delivery guy came, he gave me a receipt for 1,600 pesos, double the amount. I was really surprised and showed him the price on the website, but he said he was just the courier and couldn’t do anything. I immediately tried calling the store’s customer service, but no one picked up. I even sent them a message, but I didn’t get a reply.</p><p>At that point, I had to make a choice - either refuse the package and end up without a gift, or pay the full amount and sort things out later. Since I really didn’t want to disappoint my sister, I decided to pay. I knew she would be happy with the book, so that was the most important thing for me at the time. </p><p>Right after that, I contacted the online store’s customer service. They said they would investigate the issue and get back to me in 3 to 5 days. I waited, but no one followed up. So I contacted them again, and this time they said it was probably a system error. They promised to refund the extra amount, but it took weeks and a lot of emails to finally get part of my money back.</p><p>It was a stressful experience, and now I’m very careful when ordering online. I only use trusted websites and always double-check if the total price is final, especially when using cash on delivery."

The website seemed reliable, and the price was fine, so I placed the order. <p>But when the package arrived, I noticed something strange. The book cover looked different, and the title wasn’t the one I had ordered. In fact, the book I received was a completely different one. It was some business guide instead of a novel. </p><p>I contacted the seller and explained the situation. They asked me to return the book and said they would send the correct one. But the return process was complicated. I had to print a form, repackage the book, and go to a post office. It was a lot of effort for a simple mistake on their part. </p><p>Eventually, I did get the right book, but it took over three weeks. This experience taught me that even with reliable-looking websites, mistakes can happen, and it’s important to check reviews and return policies before ordering anything online."

At first, I wanted to find a suitable one online, but I was overwhelmed by the number of options available. In the end, I decided to go to a reputable electronics store as I wasn't ready to throw money away and buy the first thing I saw online. So I went to the store. <p>The shop assistant listened to me really carefully and quickly helped find the right solution for my individual needs, not just sold me something because that ‘something' would pay him more. Unfortunately, the laptop I'd chosen appeared to be out of stock, so he said he would contact other branches to find the model I wanted. He said this would take a day or two. Of course, I agreed to wait a bit. I asked the shop assistant to keep me updated in order to understand whether I would get the laptop or have to find it elsewhere.</p><p>However, <u>I had been kept totally in the dark about what the situation was like for about a week</u> until I contacted the shop's customer support service myself and complained about it. </p><p>A customer service manager listened to me very carefully. Then <u>she sincerely apologized for the trouble I had to experience with the company and promised to deal with this issue as quickly as humanly possible</u>.  The manager called me back within 30 minutes and told me about what had happened. She promised I would get my order the following day. I did get it. Also, <u>the company offered me a big discount</u>, which was very nice. </p><p>Several days later she called me again to make sure everything was ok. This way, she let me know that she hadn't forgotten about me. It may not sound like much, but it really made me feel valued as a customer. And I really appreciated that."

This means that children, elderly people, most women won't be able to get there. It's only feasible for young people, who are often lazy and don't want to visit places of historic value. So it appears that those who would be interested in visiting this place will have difficulty doing it. Those who could get there aren't really interested. As a result, this place is not popular with tourists. But I believe it deserves much more attention. "

Honestly, we could run any kind of business we wanted. <p>The main reason I’d love to work with him is that I’m sure he could build a really successful company. He’s a natural-born entrepreneur. Everyone who knows him says that if he started a business, he’d definitely make a lot of money.</p><p>Even as a kid, he was always coming up with clever ways to make money. For example, he used to organize garage sales. When he ran out of stuff from his own garage, he asked his friends if he could help them sell things at their houses. In the summer, he sold homemade lemonade.</p><p>One of my favourite stories is about how he bought a whole pizza for $3 and then sold it by the slice for a total of $4 or $5. He made a profit without much effort. I think that really shows he has a natural business flair.</p><p>These days, people say it’s a shame he only used that talent when he was a kid. But the good news is, he now has real experience in sales, which is often the key to success.</p><p>What’s also great is that we complement each other really well.

I’m pretty sure I’d been to zoos as a child, but I honestly don’t remember much about those visits. <p>There were quite a few animals there - lions, zebras, elephants, and some monkeys. At first, I was curious to see them, but that feeling didn’t last long. The enclosures were small and looked really depressing. </p><p>The one moment I remember clearly is when I saw a white tiger. It was lying motionless on a concrete floor in a tiny enclosure with no natural light. It looked exhausted and just… completely lifeless, as if it had given up. The cage was small, dark, and had nothing inside that resembled a natural environment. No trees, no grass, no space to move around. It was hard to watch such a powerful animal trapped like that. I felt really sorry for it... and also a bit scared, to be honest. Even though I knew the bars were strong, part of me kept thinking 'what if something goes wrong?' </p><p>Sadly, most of the other animals didn’t look much better. They seemed bored, tired, and out of place. So overall, it wasn’t a great experience. I left the zoo feeling sad and uncomfortable, and I don’t think I’ll go to another one anytime soon."

And he's one of the most successful singers in the history of popular music. Just for the sake of comparison, Madonna has sold more than 100 million singles, and he has sold more than 30 million singles so far. Jason's debut album was released in 2010 and topped the charts. He even opened for Lady Gaga during one of her tours. Since that time all (or almost all) his songs have become instant hits.  <p>His songs are different, but I've noticed that all his biggest hits contain a rhythmic pattern which makes them stick inside your head and which makes you move even if you aren't in the mood for dancing. Probably this is the reason why <u>his songs have topped the pop singles charts in many countries for the last several years</u>. ...and also the reason why <u>many of his songs went viral on TikTok</u>. I remember when I heard his 'Savage love', I couldn't get the song out of my head for a week. </p><p>And although I sometimes suffer from the stuck song syndrome when I listen to his songs, I like listening to them. And I do it almost every day. First of all, <u>his songs give me energy and get me going every morning, especially when I can't get out of bed</u>. <u>Also, his songs' rapid beat makes me want to get up and jump around</u>. <u>What's important is that they help me pace myself during a run</u>. <u>I also sing along to his songs when I'm cooking, driving, cleaning my flat, surfing the Net or just need a diversion</u>. And there's one interesting thing which is somewhat hard to explain. <u>His songs make me feel more powerful</u>. Actually, it doesn't matter how it works as long as it has a positive impact on me. </p><p>As you might imagine, I don't know him personally. So I can't be sure that what I think of him is true. But judging by his achievements, he is ambitious, hardworking, brave and disciplined. Also, I follow him on TikTok (by the way, he's one of the most-followed personalities on the platform), and it seems to me that the word that best describes him is optimistic. He always smiles, and I don't think it's a fake smile. At least his smile doesn't look like a fake one."

I GOT SUPER PSYCHED ABOUT THE IDEA 'cause it was something I hadn't done before. We did a quick online search for escape rooms in that area and chose the one that had lots of good customer reviews. <p>There were 4 of us. We were kind of spies who broke into someone's house to find some secret files. Frankly speaking, I don't remember the storyline in detail, but I remember that we had one hour to escape the room to avoid being caught and imprisoned.</p><p>The room, in which we were locked, was packed with different stuff such as books, maps, fedoras, magnets, sticky notes, watches, old wigs, compasses, lamps, board games, playing cards. We were frantically searching for clues. Some of them involved solving riddles, putting items in the correct order, or finding a set of objects hidden in the room. <u>The puzzles were really challenging</u>. </p><p><u>And it was real fun</u>. What I will never forget is that there was a broken clock, and for a long time we couldn't figure out that we had to pay attention to the time it stopped on.

My mom always said, ‘Don’t talk to strangers, it’s not safe.’ So if I’m waiting somewhere, I usually just read or scroll through my phone. But one time at the airport, things didn’t go the usual way. <p>A man, probably in his late 30s or early 40s, sat next to me. It was the only free seat. He started a bit of small talk, and at first, I kept my distance. I gave short answers and pretended to be busy. But he had this calm, respectful energy and asked thoughtful questions. I didn’t even realize how it happened, but I opened up to him…  a total stranger. </p><p>It turned out he was a psychotherapist. We started with small talk, but somehow the conversation naturally moved toward deeper topics — limiting beliefs, childhood patterns, even how family dynamics can shape the way we approach relationships. At one point, I told him about my complicated situation with my husband. And he shared a different perspective, not just as a therapist, but also as a man. It really made me think. I started seeing things from a completely different angle. </p><p>That conversation honestly left a mark. I remember walking away feeling lighter, like something shifted in me. And to this day, whenever I face issues in my relationship, I often go back to that moment and what we talked about. I never expected to have such a meaningful, eye-opening conversation with someone I had never met before, but I’m really glad I did."

I was overthinking it, like, ‘What if I look ridiculous?’ or ‘What if people judge me?’ <p>And then one day this random guy popped up on my feed. He was doing the exact same dance, but honestly, he wasn’t good at it at all. His moves were all over the place, and he was totally off the beat. But he looked like he was having the best time. He didn’t care what anyone thought. He was just enjoying himself. </p><p>That really stuck with me. I thought, ‘If he can post that and just have fun with it, why not me?’ So I finally decided to go for it. I learned the moves… well, sort of… and I recorded myself doing the dance. I wasn’t perfect either, but honestly, that wasn’t the point anymore. It was about having fun and doing something just because I wanted to. </p><p>When I posted it, I actually felt kind of proud. A few of my friends even commented and said it made them smile, which was really nice. It sounds like such a small thing, but for me it was a little step out of my comfort zone. And now I don’t think twice about joining fun trends or posting silly stuff. It kind of helped me stop taking things so seriously online."

He also shared a series of posts around his 50th birthday, where instead of throwing a big party or focusing on gifts, he launched a birthday fundraiser to raise money for children in need. </p><p>That really inspired me. I suddenly realised how many kids out there still need support and how important it is for more people to get involved. What inspired me most was that he didn’t just donate money quietly. He used his birthday, something personal, to make a difference. That gave me the idea to do something similar, but in my own way. </p><p>So I visited a local children’s home with a couple of friends. We brought some gifts and spent a few hours with the kids — playing games, talking, just giving them some attention. It wasn’t just meaningful. It was actually a really interesting experience. I’d never done anything like that before, and it made me see things from a totally different angle."

So from time to time, like once a week or once a fortnight, I go to his place to make sure everything's ok. <u>There is remote control heating, lighting, and sound systems, floor heating and cooling, automatic blinds</u>. Plus, there are 2 or 3 surveillance cameras inside. So I wouldn't have to visit it so often if there weren't houseplants that my friends likes so much. They are like his pets. So they have to be taken good care of. <p>It's <u>a very spacious 3 bedroom flat in a newly-build block of flats</u>. What I like the most about it is <u>big floor-to-ceiling windows that let a lot of natural light in</u>.

First of all, <u>it's too big to clean without using a cleaning service or having a full-time cleaner</u>. And that's quite expensive, I think. Also, <u>you pay more in utilities to heat and cool those extra rooms, and you spend more on furnishings to fill them up</u>. And, to be honest, <u>I don't see any point in paying ALL the time for a lot of space I will only use SOME of the time</u>. What's more, <u>it doesn't feel like home</u>. And <u>I don't want to live in a flat that is Pinterest-perfect and looks like a museum</u>. In my opinion, <u>a flat shouldn't be as perfect or sterile as a builder's model home</u>.

But when he sat down and took the first bite, he looked at me like I had just cooked something from a five-star restaurant. He started saying how good it was, how much he appreciated it, and honestly, he couldn’t stop talking about it. <p>And the funny thing is, he does that every single day. It’s not like I’m trying new recipes or anything; it’s just simple food, but he always makes a big deal out of it. He usually smiles, leans back in his chair, and says something like, ‘Best breakfast ever!’. Even though he says it every morning, it still makes me laugh. </p><p>At first, I used to roll my eyes and laugh it off, but after a while, I realized it actually means a lot to me. It’s a small moment, but it makes me feel really appreciated. Like, even the little things I do are noticed and valued.

He even said something like, ‘This is the kind of dedication we like to see’. It kind of caught me off guard because I wasn’t expecting to be singled out like that. </p><p>To be honest, I felt a bit awkward. I wasn’t doing it for praise or anything. I just thought it was part of the job. Plus, I know a lot of other people in the team also stay late and work hard, but they don’t always get noticed. So in a way, I felt a bit guilty, like I was getting credit for something that wasn’t just my effort. At the same time, it was nice to hear that what I did didn’t go unnoticed.

Maybe I was just bored, or maybe the mess finally started to annoy me. <p>Anyway, when my mom saw it, she was genuinely surprised. She literally walked past my room, stopped, and backed up like, ‘Wait… you cleaned? On your own?’ And then she smiled and said she was really proud of me for taking the initiative without her having to ask. </p><p>To be honest, it felt kind of good. I’m not used to getting praised for small stuff like that, so it caught me a bit off guard. I just shrugged it off at the time, but deep down it made me feel pretty good… like I’d done something grown-up for once. </p><p>I mean, it’s not like I’m suddenly super tidy now, but after that, I kinda realized that doing small things without being told isn’t that hard.

It felt more like an adventure than a regular trip. </p><p>To be honest, I was excited and a little nervous at the same time.

Finally, last year, my dream came true, and I bought it during the Black Friday sale. The TV itself is fantastic, but the remote control that came with it is a different story. It turned out to be so hard to use that it's been almost a year since I bought it, and I'm still trying to figure out how to use all those features that make this TV ‘smart’. I think this remote control was made to make people doubt their IQ ‘cause, you know, it’s like a mini spaceship control panel. It has more buttons than I know what to do with. <p>Every time I want to watch a show or movie, it turns into a challenge. For example, it has a touchpad that is supposed to make navigation easier, but instead, I find myself accidentally swiping the wrong way and ending up in menus I didn't even know existed. One time, I somehow changed the language settings to French, and I had no clue how to get back to English. I had to google it. </p><p>Plus, I have a really hard time using the back button. It’s too sensitive, so it always causes me to accidentally go back when I didn’t mean to. </p><p>Then there's the voice control feature. In theory, it sounds amazing. Just say what you want to watch, and it appears on the screen. But for some reason, it hardly ever understands me. I’ll say, ‘Play the latest episode of Love is Blind’ and the TV responds with, ‘Playing a documentary about sea turtles’. It's as if the remote has a mind of its own. <p></p>Despite all these challenges, I use the smart TV remote every day. I literally have no choice now.

					"text": "<arrow>If you had asked me about a place where I’d like to stay for some time just a week ago, I probably wouldn’t have had an answer. But recently, I came across a video on YouTube that completely changed my mind. It showed a stunning, modern house with a sleek design, a big backyard with grass, and an in-ground pool. I was blown away when I saw it. It was exactly the kind of place I would love to stay in for a while.<p>The house in the video was a rectangular, ultra-modern home with clean, straight lines, made of concrete, steel, and glass. The outside was either white or black, but honestly, the color didn’t matter much. What really caught my attention was the overall design - a geometric building without a traditional roof, just a smooth, modern structure. </p><p>Inside, the house was just as incredible. It was a two-story home with an open floor plan, high ceilings, and big floor-to-ceiling windows that filled the space with natural light. The style was minimalist, but it had some loft-style elements like concrete walls, oak floors, and marble accents. I loved how modern and simple it looked, yet it still felt warm and comfortable. </p><p>Of course, the house was equipped with all the latest technology—remote control heating, lighting, sound systems, automatic blinds, and even floor heating and cooling. One of my favorite features was the surround sound system that played music throughout the house. </p><p>It was definitely a large house—tall ceilings, spacious rooms, huge staircases, garages for several cars, and every room you could dream of. There was a kitchen, dining room, walk-in closets, media room, home office, and even bathrooms with whirlpool tubs. It had everything to make staying there feel like a dream. I think a house like this would be perfect in a big city like London or New York, where it would really stand out."

					"text": "<arrow>Recently my friend invited me to grab some coffee and catch up. One of the things he told me was that he started  thinking of investing his life savings in cryptocurrency. He said it was the best time to invest 'cause the price of bitcoin and several other leading cryptocurrencies had suffered huge falls in December, so the price of bitcoin plunged to about 70000 dollars, but some analysts are predicting the price of bitcoin could hit 100000 dollars by the end of the next year.  And there are a lot of new coins that he thinks will make a good investment as well.  One more reason why he said cryptocurrency could make a good investment is that everyone says cryptocurrency is the future 'currency of the internet' and ultimate store of wealth. What's more, transactions are fast, digital, secure and worldwide, which allows the maintenance of records without risk of data being pirated. </p><p>Despite all this, it was obvious he couldn't make up his mind. I'm sure what I told him didn't help him at all 'cause my knowledge of cryptocurrency is limited. All I could tell him was a couple of stories of bitcoin millionaires and losses. For instance, I told him a sad story of some guy who accidentally threw away 7500 bitcoins when he got rid of an old laptop hard drive. He bought them when they were worth 1 dollar. And they are worth over 200 million dollars today. He now wants to dig up his local rubbish tip, hoping to find the old drive. Also, I told him that if I were him, I wouldn't invest more than I can afford to lose, and that I wouldn't invest all my life savings. In my opinion, the discussion was really fruitful as it helped me form a balanced opinion on this matter. And now I'm planning to invest a small amount of money in bitcoin in the near future. But it seems to me my friend began to doubt even more."
